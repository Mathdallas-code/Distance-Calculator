# Distance-Calculator
This is a Distance Calculator I made.

## How to use

Simply download this code or clone it using git.
Then, in the folder which was cloned, try any of these commands -

- `python distance_calculator`
- `python3 distance_calculator`
- `python -m distance_calculator`
- `python3 -m distance_calculator`

I made this mainly to find issues in it.
If you find a bug or an error, feel free to open an issue and I will solve it.
